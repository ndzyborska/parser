For my extension I decided I wanted to make something visual. For this, I created
3 functions: CHANGE, MAKE and SPLIT.

SPLIT: I was really keen on trying to create a fractal tree, so the split function
creates 2 separate 'branches' for a given ditance at equal angles right and left.
To initialise the tree, the tree was given the current coordinates of the
previous command (to branch from), and then the VARNUM was inserted into the tree.
The insert function went down the tree, checked that left AND right nodes were NULL,
and created new coordinates for those nodes (using the normal Coordinate calculator).
If they were not null, recurse call the function for both left and right nodes.
Trees can be seen using 'make split' and 'make splits'.

CHANGE: This allows you to make a jump, or set up your initial coordinates. This came
in handy when i didnt want the function to begin in the centre.

MAKE: This function took in a VARNUM, which would be used as a radius for a circle to
be drawn. See 'make circle'.
